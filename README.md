Implementation from http://www.mygamefast.com/volume1/ Followed until Issue 7, but with some necessary changes because of Panda3D updates. 

I skipped the water, sound and OOP parts because I am curretly mostly interested to implement an AI in the game.

Shared here mostly because of a request in the offical forum. https://discourse.panda3d.org/t/dirty-indentation-on-mygamefast-tuto-with-aircraft-example/24447/3
